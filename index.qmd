# Course Description
In this comprehensive course, you will learn how to create interactive and informative dashboards using the R programming language. Dashboards are essential tools for data visualization and communication, and R provides powerful libraries and tools to build them. Whether you are a data scientist, analyst, or anyone interested in presenting data effectively, this course will equip you with the skills to design and develop insightful dashboards.

## What you'll learn in this course? 
- R Markdown
- Create your own dashboard
- Dashboard components and layout
- Combining `flexdashboard` with `Shiny`

## Why dashboard is so important in healthcare?
Dashboards play a crucial role in healthcare by providing a visual and interactive platform for monitoring, analyzing, and managing various aspects of healthcare operations and patient care. Here are some of the key reasons why dashboards are important in the healthcare industry:

- Real-time Monitoring: Healthcare dashboards allow healthcare professionals to monitor patient data, equipment status, and key performance indicators in real-time. This real-time monitoring can be vital for making quick decisions and responding to critical situations promptly.

- Clinical Decision Support: Dashboards can integrate patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) and other sources, helping clinicians make informed decisions about patient care. They can provide alerts, reminders, and clinical guidelines to improve patient outcomes and reduce errors.

- Patient Management: Healthcare dashboards enable healthcare providers to track patient progress, medication adherence, and vital signs. This helps in providing personalized care plans and interventions, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

- Resource Allocation: Hospitals and healthcare organizations can use dashboards to optimize resource allocation, including staffing, equipment, and bed management. This ensures that resources are efficiently distributed, reducing wait times and improving patient satisfaction.

- Financial Management: Dashboards in healthcare can provide insights into revenue cycles, billing, and claims processing. They help in identifying areas for cost reduction and revenue enhancement, contributing to the financial health of healthcare institutions.


- Quality Improvement: Healthcare dashboards can track and visualize key quality metrics, such as readmission rates, infection rates, and patient satisfaction scores. This information is vital for quality improvement initiatives and compliance with regulatory standards.

- Population Health Management: Healthcare organizations can use dashboards to analyze and manage the health of entire populations. This includes identifying high-risk patients, monitoring disease outbreaks, and implementing preventive measures.

- Data Analytics: Dashboards facilitate data-driven decision-making by providing data analytics tools and visualization capabilities. Healthcare professionals can explore data trends, patterns, and correlations to gain insights into patient care and operational efficiency.

- Patient Engagement: Some healthcare dashboards are patient-facing, allowing patients to access their health records, schedule appointments, and communicate with healthcare providers. Patient engagement is essential for promoting active participation in their healthcare.

- Compliance and Reporting: Dashboards help healthcare institutions track and report on compliance with healthcare regulations and standards. This ensures that the organization remains in good standing with regulatory bodies.

- Emergency Preparedness: In times of emergencies or pandemics, dashboards can be used to track the spread of diseases, hospital capacity, and resource availability. This information is crucial for effective emergency response and resource allocation.

- Research and Education: Healthcare dashboards can support medical research by providing access to large datasets for analysis. They are also valuable tools for medical education and training.






## Prework

Before attending the workshop please have the following installed and configured on your machine.

-   Recent version of **R** 

-   Recent version of **RStudio**


Install the flexdashboard package from CRAN as follows:

```{r}
#| label: install-flexdashboard 
#| eval: false
install.packages("flexdashboard")
```

If you want to use the development version of the flexdashboard package, you can install the package from GitHub via the remotes package:

```{r}
#| label: install-flexdashboard-dev
#| eval: false
remotes::install_github('rstudio/flexdashboard')
```
